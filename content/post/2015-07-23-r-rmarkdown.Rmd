# Abstraction
Since bicycles entered the human history, they have been helping improve human 
beings' lives in many aspects. They offer a cheaper, healthier way for 
people to travel around the city and provides a solution to better environments.
Therefore, It is very necessary to understand which part of the city has 
occurred more bicycle thefts and we need to be careful when entering these areas
so as to reduce the chances of getting our friend stolen.

# Introduction
As people have noticed, bicycles are playing a very important role in our lives.
We use them for commuting, cardio exercising and even sightseeing. Therefore, it
is necessary to protect our bicycles from incidents like being stolen. Besides 
physical protection like stronger bicycle locks, I feel like we need to know a 
little knowledge about which areas of the city that bicycles are more likely to 
be stolen so as we should be more cautious when entering these areas.

To start with, I use a data set called "Bicycle Thefts" from the open data 
portal of Toronto to help with my study. This data set records information of 
all the bicycle thefts reported from year 2014 to 2019. Since I am more 
interested in the areas where the thefts occur, I choose to make a bar plot 
with information under "Division" section. It is surprising that there were more
bicycle theft events happening in division 14, 51 and 52, with nearly 4000 
counts respectively. By checking the "Toronto Police Service" website, I figure
out that these three divisions cover almost the entire downtown area of Toronto,
which means we should always be more careful when leaving our bicycles 
alone in downtown area. Also, I plot the bar plot of the colors of the stolen 
bikes to see if there is a relation. The result shows there are several colors 
which appear way more often than others, which means there is a relation between
stolen bikes and their colors.

In general, in order to protect our bicycles better, we should always be careful
when leaving them in downtown area, even for a short amount of time as less than
10 percent of these stolen bicycles have been recovered according to the police.
The weakness of this study is that there may be bicycle thefts not reported to
the police or people may not inform the police whether they find their bicycle, 
which leads to an influence on accuracy of the data. In the future, people 
should look after their bikes better with stronger protections since bicycles
improve our life qualities.

I obtain the graphs with following codes in RStudio Cloud. However, I am not 
able to knit it to PDF because there is error showing up. I cannot figure out
why. Thus, I cannot show the graph since Rstudio seems not to allow 
inserting graphs or screenshots directly. But I copy and paste the codes below 
to prove what I am trying to do.
